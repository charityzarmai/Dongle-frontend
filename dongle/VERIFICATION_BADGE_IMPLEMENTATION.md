# Verification Status Badge Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of consistent verification status indicators across the application.

## Problem Solved
Previously, verification status was only shown in a standalone component on the verification page. Project cards, detail pages, and discovery listings did not consistently display verification status, making it difficult for users to identify which projects were verified, pending, or rejected.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **VerificationBadge Component** (`components/projects/VerificationBadge.tsx`)
- Reusable component for displaying verification status
- Supports four states: NONE, PENDING, VERIFIED, REJECTED
- Configurable with/without icons
- Uses consistent color coding:
  - **VERIFIED**: Green badge with checkmark
  - **PENDING**: Yellow badge with clock icon
  - **REJECTED**: Red badge with X icon
  - **NONE/Unverified**: Gray badge with alert icon

### 2. **ProjectCard Component** (Updated)
- Added optional `verificationStatus` prop
- Displays verification badge alongside category badge
- Badge is shown for all projects when status is available
- Responsive layout handles both badges gracefully

### 3. **Discover Page** (Updated)
- Fetches verification statuses for all projects on load
- Added verification status filter dropdown
- Filter options: All Status, Verified, Pending, Unverified, Rejected
- Integrates with existing search, category, tags, and sort filters
- Projects display verification badges in cards

### 4. **Project Detail Page** (Updated)
- Verification badge displayed in project header next to category
- Existing warning banners remain unchanged
- Badge provides at-a-glance status without reading full warnings

### 5. **Featured Projects (Landing Page)** (Updated)
- Fetches verification statuses for displayed projects
- Shows verification badges on featured project cards
- Updates when filters change

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Verified projects have a consistent badge**
- All verified projects show green "Verified" badge with shield icon
- Badge appears consistently across all views

✅ **Users can filter Discover by verification status**
- Dropdown filter added to Discover page
- Can filter by: All, Verified, Pending, Unverified, Rejected
- Filter works alongside existing category and tag filters

✅ **Rejected or pending projects are not confused with verified projects**
- Clear visual distinction with color coding
- Rejected: Red badge with X icon
- Pending: Yellow badge with clock icon
- Verified: Green badge with checkmark
- Unverified: Gray badge with alert icon

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. Verification statuses are fetched from `sorobanService.getVerificationStatus()`
2. Statuses are stored in component state as `Record<string, VerificationStatus>`
3. Status is passed to ProjectCard as prop when available
4. Badge component handles visual representation

### Performance Considerations
- Verification statuses fetched in parallel using `Promise.all()`
- Fetched once on page load (Discover, Landing)
- Fetched once on project detail page load
- Uses existing verification service infrastructure

### Component Integration
- **VerificationBadge**: Standalone, reusable component
- **ProjectCard**: Backward compatible (status prop is optional)
- **Discover**: Statuses fetched and passed to cards
- **Project Detail**: Status fetched and displayed in header
- **Featured Projects**: Statuses fetched for visible projects

## Files Modified
1. `dongle/components/projects/VerificationBadge.tsx` (NEW)
2. `dongle/components/projects/ProjectCard.tsx`
3. `dongle/app/discover/page.tsx`
4. `dongle/app/projects/[id]/page.tsx`
5. `dongle/components/landing/FeaturedProjects.tsx`
6. `dongle/components/projects/RecentlyViewedProjects.tsx` (Updated)
7. `dongle/app/profile/page.tsx` (Updated)

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { VerificationBadge } from "@/components/projects/VerificationBadge";

// With icon
<VerificationBadge status="VERIFIED" showIcon={true} />

// Without icon
<VerificationBadge status="PENDING" showIcon={false} />

// In ProjectCard
<ProjectCard project={project} verificationStatus="VERIFIED" />
```

## Future Enhancements
- Cache verification statuses to reduce API calls
- Add verification status to URL params in Discover
- Show verification count in filter options
- Add verification date/timestamp to badge tooltip
- Implement real-time status updates via WebSocket
